  __NOTE:__ For Windows or macOS, a native binary will be downloaded. Run the binary as per
  the instructions given in the official documentation.

- Once you are done with the installation, verify the setup by checking its version as (_version might vary in your machine_):

  ```shell
  $ docker version
  Client:
  Cloud integration: 1.0.17
  Version:           20.10.8
  API version:       1.41
  ... [ omitted ] ...
  Experimental:      true

  Server: Docker Engine - Community
  Engine:
    Version:          20.10.8
    API version:      1.41 (minimum version 1.12)
    ... [ omitted ] ...
    GitCommit:        v1.0.1-0-g4144b63
  docker-init:
    Version:          0.19.0
    GitCommit:        de40ad0
  ```
